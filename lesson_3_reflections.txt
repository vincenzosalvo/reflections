When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	I will use a remote repository whenever I want to collaborate with other developers and share my work.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Pulling changes manually allows you to avoid conflicts between remote and local repositories.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Forks are a GitHub feature to create a personal copy of a repository on GitHub to your GitHub account.
	Forks allow you to start working from an existing repository without requiring permissions.
	The original repository will not be changed but it will be linked to the forked one.
	Clone allows you to create a local copy of a remote or a local repository.
	Branches involve non-linear developing and allow you to start a new line of development in your project (e.g. experimental features).

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?



How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?



When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
